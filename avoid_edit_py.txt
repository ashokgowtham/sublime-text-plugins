Foreword:
edit.py is used within non-TextCommand commands to do text manipulations.

How to avoid the need for edit.py
write text manipulation commands as text commands
any information required by the text command should be passed as arguments rather than the command itself trying to get from user/io/interaction
write another command - maybe WindowCommand that does the interaction part of getting the necessary data for the TextCommand and then executes the TextCommand giving the data as arguments
This way, interaction commands will be separated from text manipulation commands and thus the necessity for edit.py will be avoided.
