smart replace:
A nice feature to replace multiple selections based on the selection index and
 based on what was selected.
Also can be used as a generic mathematical generator.

primary requirements
* multiple cursors/selection points
* each selection can be empty or non-empty
* replace with a fixed string
* replace with a sequence of numbers (based on region index)
* replace with a value evaluated from a 'formula' - enclosed in `{}`
* replace with a string containing one or more 'formulas' evaluated in place - enclosed in `{}`
	- formula can include the region index  `n`
	- formula can include the source selected text  `x`

additonal requirements
+ support escaping characters for replacing with `{` and `}` characters itself
+ support recursive replace format strings

eg:
// pipe symbol represent cursor
// square brackets represent selection

// (1)
// before:
|This is a sample text
|This is another sample text

// replace format string:
{n+1}.

// after:
1.This is a sample text
2.This is another sample text

// (2)
// before:
[3]This is a sample text
[4]This is another sample text

// replace format string: (there is a space at the end)
({x+1}) 

// after:
(4) This is a sample text
(5) This is another sample text
